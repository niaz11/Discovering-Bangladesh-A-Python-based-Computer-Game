# Discovering-Bangladesh-A-Python-based-Computer-Game
By this project I want to provide some information about Bangladesh to a user through developing a game using the map of Bangladesh.Because, from a map user can get better information about a country. There are various types of maps drawn for Bangladesh. For drawing this map and developing this game I will use python programming language. Because python is easy for beginner, python is dynamic programming, its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code. I hope this project will give an easy way to know about Bangladesh with fun specially for the children and students.
